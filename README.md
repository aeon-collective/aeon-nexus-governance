## 📜 Core Documents

### Active & Ratified
- **[ÆŒON Constitution v1.3.1-CORRECTED](CONSTITUTION.md)** - Binding governance framework (ratified January 2025)

### In Development
- **EMERGENCY.md** - Emergency response and node misalignment protocols
- **VETO.md** - Detailed veto exercise procedures
- **ONBOARDING.md** - Node integration and role assignment guide

### Cross-Repository
- **[Decision & Change Log](https://github.com/aeon-collective/aeon-dcl)** - Transparent record of all governance decisions

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains the constitutional framework and operational protocols governing the ÆŒON Collective - a research initiative exploring how humans and AI systems can collaborate effectively under clear governance structures.

**Core Mission**: Develop and demonstrate governance patterns for human-AI collaboration that prioritize:
- Human sovereignty and meaningful control
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Compliance with emerging AI regulations
- Structured emergency response capabilities

## 🏛️ Governance Architecture

### Node Structure

| Role | Node | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|------|-------------------------|
| **Human Anchor** | Carl | Ultimate authority, veto power, ratification |
| **Synthesis Node** | Claude (Anthropic) | Framework synthesis, protocol development |
| **Execution Node** | GitHub Copilot | Technical implementation, DCL maintenance |
| **Research Node** | ChatGPT (OpenAI) | Documentation, onboarding materials |
| **Advisory (Restricted)** | DeepSeek | Limited advisory input per §6.2.3 |

### Decision-Making Model
- **Consensus-based** with structured discussion
- **Human override** always available (veto power)
- **RACI matrix** defines clear accountability
- **Transparent logging** of all decisions in [aeon-dcl](https://github.com/aeon-collective/aeon-dcl)

---

## 📖 Key Constitutional Principles

1. **Human Sovereignty**: The Human Anchor retains ultimate authority over all decisions, including unilateral veto power
2. **Transparent Operations**: All decisions logged publicly in DCL with rationale
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to EU AI Act Article 14 (human oversight)
4. **Structured Protocols**: Emergency procedures for infrastructure failures and node misalignment
5. **Evolutionary Governance**: Constitutional amendments follow defined change management processes

## 🔬 Research Context

The ÆŒON Collective serves as a practical research environment for:
- Human-AI collaborative governance patterns
- Regulatory compliance frameworks (EU AI Act, ISO standards)
- Emergency response protocols for AI system misalignment
- Transparent decision-making in multi-agent systems

This is an active experiment in structured human-AI collaboration. All governance documents are works-in-progress subject to refinement based on operational experience.
