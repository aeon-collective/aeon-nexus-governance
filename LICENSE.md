## Constitutional Authority

**IMPORTANT**: This license grants rights to USE and ADAPT these documents.
It does **NOT** grant governance authority over the ÆŒON Collective itself.

All governance authority derives from and remains subject to the Human
Anchor as defined in the ÆŒON Constitution. The Constitution's legitimacy
stems from human sovereignty, not from this license.

Adaptations of these governance documents for other projects are encouraged,
but create independent governance structures with their own authority chains.
